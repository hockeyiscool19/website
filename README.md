## What I Learned

In this project, I had the opportunity to learn and work with various technologies:

1. 💡 HTML and Tailwind CSS for creating the layout.
2. 🐳 Docker for containerization.
3. 🖱️ Implementing interactivity with hover effects, event listeners, and {#if} statements using Svelte.

Despite the challenges, I'm still on my journey to mastering front-end development. I hope you enjoy exploring my portfolio!
